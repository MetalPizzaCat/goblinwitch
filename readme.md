# Goblin witch
A simple game made for Transfem GameJam

# Gameplay
Gameplay follows a very basic structure of exploring the world trying to find the exit and battling whatever enemy comes your way in turn based combat on a 6x6 grid
# Story
might write it out here if i actually give up on the idea but for now it's private
# Tools
## Godot
The game was made using (https://godotengine.org)[Godot] 4.3 .net build, although .net was not utilized so in theory it can be used with standard godot 4.3
## Level design
Level design uses (https://github.com/func-godot)[func_godot] plugin to speed up and simplify the layout building process. (https://trenchbroom.github.io/)[Trenchbroom] is the editor used to create quake map files used in the editor but in theory any editor compatible with (https://github.com/func-godot)[func_godot] can be used
## Assets
A few assets(mostly placeholders) use cc0 textures from  (https://ambientcg.com/)[ambientcg]
Models are made by me using (https://www.blender.org/)[Blender], although they are very poorly made and are not the most stable in either blender or godot, so going further will ideally be remade from scratch
