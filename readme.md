# Goblin
A simple and short adventure game with turn based combat, originally made for a gamejam on a transfem discord server. 
You play as a newly awoken adnventurer and have to fight your way out of a dungeon.

# Gameplay
Gameplay follows a very basic structure of exploring the world trying to find the exit and battling whatever enemy comes your way in turn based combat on a 6x6 grid, while using a varierty of weapons to fight enemies

# Tools
## Godot
The game was made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org) 4.3 .net build, although .net was not utilized so in theory it can be used with standard godot 4.3
## Level design
Level design uses [func_godot](https://github.com/func-godot) plugin to speed up and simplify the layout building process. [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) is the editor used to create quake map files used in the editor but in theory any editor compatible with [func_godot](https://github.com/func-godot) can be used
## Assets
A few assets(mostly placeholders) use cc0 textures from  [ambientcg](https://ambientcg.com/)
Models are made by me using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), although they are very poorly made and are not the most stable in either blender or godot, so going further will ideally be remade from scratch
